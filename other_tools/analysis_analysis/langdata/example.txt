# Example

# Example config for language data for compare_counts.pl
# Lines beginning with hashes are comments and are ignored.
# Blank lines are also ignored.

# Judicious use of regular expressions is allowed (see the French
# config), except for folding.

# Values in config lines are tab-separated. An empty value is the
# empty string. Empty strings can go anywhere, but putting them at the
# end is asking for trouble, so always put them first when possible,
# for your sanity, and the sanity of others.

# regular_suffixes and regular_prefixes are those that alternate so
# commonly that it is not surprising if words differing only in those
# affixes end up stemming together (even if they really are different
# words). A minimal stem length (default 5) is required, so that
# "nation" and "ned" stemming together doesn't count as "not
# surprising". These are used when deciding whether new additions to
# existing stemmming groups match with other existing members of the
# stemming group. i.e., when using both -n and -o.

# Example: English regular suffixes. Note that the first item here is
# the empty string.

# strip_prefixes and strip_suffixes are strippable affixes that can be
# stripped off when looking for common substrings of stemming groups.
# These are used when doing analysis on one set of results, not a
# comparison; i.e., when using only -n. Single letter affixes should
# probably not be included here because the possibility for ambiguity is
# too high.

# Example: Polish strippable affixes.

# fold provides a list of characters (or, sometimes, strings) that should
# be folded together whenever folding is done. The first item is folded
# into the second item, which may be empty. Folding is case insensitive,
# but that may not always work as expected for non-Latin characters.

# NO REGULAR EXPRESSIONS CAN BE USED IN FOLDING!

# Folds are NOT performed in order, so be wary of interactions in
# really complex folding configs. Folds on longer strings are
# performed first, and the token being folded is processed left to
# right, though all replacements for a given string to be folded are
# done at once. (This is a performance hack so that Chinese folding
# finishes before the heat death of the universe.)

# Example: Russian character folding. The first line folds ́ into
# nothing, so the empty string comes at the end of the line, alas.
